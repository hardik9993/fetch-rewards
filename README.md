# Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise

This challenge will focus on the similarity between two texts. Your objective is to write a program that takes as inputs two texts and uses a metric to determine how similar they are. Documents that are exactly the same should get a score of 1, and documents that donâ€™t have any words in common should get a score of 0. Please use the samples below to develop your application.

You will have to make a number of decisions as you develop this solution:

1) Do you count punctuation or only words? 
2) Which words should matter in the similarity comparison?
3) Do you care about the ordering of words?
4) What metric do you use to assign a numerical value to the similarity?
5) What type of data structures should be used? (Hint: Dictionaries and lists are particularly helpful data structures that can be leveraged to calculate the similarity of two pieces of text.)
